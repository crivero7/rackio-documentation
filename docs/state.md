## State Machine Definitions

According to the Wikipedia, a state machine has the following definition:

> A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural: automata), finite automaton, or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition.

State Machines are widely used in the automation field, this is a concept in which you can define a system that is continously transitioning between states in order to perform some tasks or operations, in a automated or semiautomated way.

With Rackio you can use a declarative approach to define your custom state machines.

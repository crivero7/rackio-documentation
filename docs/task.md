## Custom Continous Tasks

In some cases State Machines is not enough and you need to perform some complex continous task in a specified fequency, e.g. a data acquisition process, with Rackio you can use decorators that allow you to register a function definition as a Rackio pluging. Once your application is up an running these continous tasks will start working until the end of times.
